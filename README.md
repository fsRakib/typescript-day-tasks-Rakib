# TypeScript Day Tasks - Rakib

This repository contains TypeScript practice code for daily tasks.

Files of interest:

- `src/day1.ts` - Example exercises covering TypeScript basics: interfaces, union types, generics, utility types, enums, async functions.

How to build and run:

1. Install dependencies (Node.js and npm are required):

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run the compiled output:

   ```powershell
   node dist/day1.js
   ```

Notes:

- `tsc` is configured to emit files to `dist/` via `tsconfig.json`.
- If you don't have npm available, you can compile using the TypeScript playground or install `typescript` globally.
- The project is intentionally minimal; feel free to add tests or more tasks.
